# Welcome to My Linear Regression
***

## Task
The task is to study linear regression, loss function, and gradient descent optimization algorithms in more details.

## Description
The problem is solved using two methods: 1) Closed-form solution, where matrix manipulations are performed to identify the optimal solution, and 2) gradient descent algorithm, where step-by-step optimization is performed.

## Installation
There is no need to explicitly install the project. It is required to run the project and observe the results in jupyter notebook.

## Usage
The functions inside the jupyter notebook can be used in other projects by importing them directly or copying them using clipboard.
